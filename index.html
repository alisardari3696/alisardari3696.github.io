  <!-- New Athlete & Instrument Player Experience -->
  <h4>Athlete & Instrument Player</h4>
  <p>
    For more than 18 years, I have been deeply engaged in both sports and music.  
    As an athlete, I practiced boxing, running, and volleyball, and earned degrees in physical fitness, including certification as a third-grade coach.  
    I also completed courses in fitness and fat-burning exercises, and I am a skilled swimmer.  
    Alongside sports, I have played traditional Iranian instruments — Setar, Tar, and Tonbak — with dedication and artistry for nearly two decades.  
    These experiences reflect discipline, resilience, and creativity, shaping both my professional and personal growth.

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          I love learning, because every new idea makes me a little better than yesterday. 
          I love reading, poetry, and running — each one gives me space to breathe and think. 
          I love trading, because it challenges me and reminds me that freedom is the real reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The common thread in all of this is freedom: freedom to grow, freedom to explore, 
          freedom to live life on my own terms. My purpose is simple — to keep moving forward, 
          becoming better every day in every aspect.
