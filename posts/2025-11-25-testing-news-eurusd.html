    <h3>Step 1: Collecting News Data</h3>
    <p>I focused on the economic calendar and merged EUR/USD daily price data with a binary indicator for high‑impact news events. This allowed me to isolate the days where market reactions should be strongest.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Testing Machine Learning on News</h3>
    <p>I trained a machine learning model to see if high‑impact news could predict EUR/USD moves. The idea was to measure whether news days left a consistent footprint in returns. Unfortunately, the model didn’t find meaningful patterns — the market’s noise overwhelmed the signal.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Backtesting the Post-News Strategy</h3>
    <p>Later in the evening, I switched to backtesting a trading strategy built around news candles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On a news day, measure the candle’s body.</li>
      <li>Place a pending order at 25% of that body size away from the close.</li>
      <li>Stop loss at the signal day’s high or low.</li>
      <li>Take profit at 1.5R.</li>
      <li>Only allow the order to trigger on the next day; cancel if not triggered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite repairing the dataset (open = previous close), the backtest still had bugs. Some trades that should have triggered — like the first January news day — weren’t showing up. This suggests either the dataset still has issues or the trigger logic needs refining.</p>

    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High‑impact news alone may not provide a clean predictive edge.</li>
      <li>Data integrity is critical — even small errors in OHLC values can invalidate backtests.</li>
      <li>Strategy rules must be coded carefully to match real chart behavior.</li>
      <li>Failed attempts are still progress: they highlight what needs fixing next.</li>
    </ul>
