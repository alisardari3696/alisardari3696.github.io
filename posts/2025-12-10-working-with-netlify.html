    <h3>Trying Out Netlify</h3>
    <p>Today I experimented with Netlify to see if I could publish posts without manually editing code each time. I spent nearly seven hours troubleshooting, facing many errors and failures along the way.</p>

    <h3>Progress and Challenges</h3>
    <p>Eventually, I reached the point where I could create a post simply by writing. However, the post didn’t appear on the site even though the file was created. While fixing this issue, I discovered there were platform limits, and I decided to stop working for the day.</p>

    <h3>Reflections</h3>
    <p>Hand‑coding posts after such effort feels harsh, but I wanted to document the process. Even though the attempt wasn’t fully successful, it marked progress toward a smoother publishing workflow.</p>
